*Added the functionality to prevent a user from deleting the defualt address until they have chosen a different one.  
This also prevented the issue on the checkout screen where you would see no address if there was not a defualt one stored in the memory

*Added functionality for a user to choose a new address at the checkout - calls the new address function and also sets an indicator to
