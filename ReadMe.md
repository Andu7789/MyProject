# My First Project

## Recipe finder and shop

This site was created to showcase my learnings from a 12 week course (an Introduction to learning HTML, Javascripts and c#) and formed part of my final presentation.

## Libraries, Technologies and Techniques

## Design

### Scope

The scope of the project has grown over the 12 weeks of the course.  Initially the idea was to have just the 2 pages (recipe finder and a phone shop)...  As it is, to create those 2 pages didn't take me long so I started to investigate what other features I could add to stretch myself and from that small acorn grew a not too small Oak!!  

As the shopping side of the project took shape I took inspiration from Tesco.co.uk and Amazon.com to see which features they provided and to see if I could work out how to replicate them.

### Structure

## Future Feature Enhancements

## Known outstanding bugs

1. Previous Orders sometimes duplicate
    * Clicking back and forth through the site can cause items to be duplicated when the order is completed and the previous order is populated - This does not affect actual orders.

2. Intermittent behaviour when on the 'choose new address screen'. 
     * Sometimes when a user clicks on 'cancel' the program will take the user back to the recipe screen.  Other times it will act as expected.

## Contributors

Thanks goes to Colin Mattholie for reviewing the build each week and providing value feedback and spotting bugs.  Thanks also goes to Paul Ginn for the idea of adding the discount code section.  

Many thanks also to the numerous You-Tubers who have led me down many a rabbit hole but without who I would not have been able to create this site.
